# Dice-Probability-Estimation-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Simulates rolling two 6-sided dice to estimate the probability of reaching or exceeding a target sum using Monte Carlo trials. Implements a custom isEvent function and compares estimates across 5,000 to 100,000 trials with known actual probabilities for validation.
